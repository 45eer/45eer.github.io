  <p>Formula 1 (F1 or Formula One) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing that is sanctioned by the FIA, or Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, which is the governing body for many motorsport events around the world.
    F1 had it's roots in European Grand Prix Motor Racing in the 1920s before it came into it's own with the inaugural season in 1950.

    There are two championships running at the same time; one for the drivers and one for the constructors (teams).
    Each race awards the top ten drivers with points that apply to their individual driver standings as well as their team standings along with their teammate. Each team fields two cars and two drivers which, as of the current season, makes up a 20 car grid.

    The current Formula 1 season is made up of 21 races across 21 different countries in the world. It starts in March and ends on the first of December. Each event takes place over a weekend and consists of three free practice sessions, followed by three qualifying sessions, and culminating in the race itself which lasts for the least amount of laps that add up to 305km to help keep the race under 2 hours.
    The only exception to this is Monaco which consists of about 260km or 77 laps. A very good resource containing a lot of useful information on these things and more can be found on the official website <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1.html">here.</a>
