  <div id="infobox">
    <p>Thanks for checking out the website and reading this page! This website was created for an assignment for HCI 525 - Hypermedia. It was to get us students exposed to and start learning how to use HTML5 and CSS.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="infobox">
    <p>The students were directed to create a website on something that interested them or a hobby and to try and incporate many different features of HTML5 and CSS to try and get a good understanding of the language.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="infobox">
    <p>There was a lot of learning that took place, and looking back on it I can see where I would have wanted to approach things somewhat differently. Probably the biggest place is cleaning up the code and making more extensive use of the external css file and classes instead of relying so much on internal styling and inline styling.
      Hopefully in future projects, this will be one of the improvements people will be able to see over time. </p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p style=" text-align: center;">With that in mind, this website is the very first website I have created and will serve as something that I can compare against in the future
    to see how much I progress and how my mastery over the language and web design evolves over time. It will be something that I will include in my portfolio, which I hope to also make by hand and eventually link here as well.</p>
